# Facebook Field Guide to Machine-Learning
So this is a guide to best real-world practices and provides practical tips about how to apply machine-learning capabilities to real-world problems.

If you are using machine learning to enhance your product in the real world, itâ€™s important to understand how the entire development process works not just running the models.

The discussed below points are the concepts taught by Facebook ads machine learning team and will cover 6 major steps :

1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Model
6. Experimentation

### Problem Definition

To enter into real world and deal with problems ensuring proper implementation of business model as well requires not only knowledge of ML model or libraries. It also requires in depth analysis and research what exactly the problem is. We can not use a pre existing model for a new real world problem, we need to design a optimized solution for it.

Instead of having complex and expensive solutions and end frameworks one can easily provide simple options to like do ads are relevant or not and user can select by himself. And by this simple method we can use less complex ligression models.

Things to be taken care of:

1. Determine the right task for your project
2. Simple is better than complicated
3. Define your label and training example precisely
4. Don't prematurely optimize
